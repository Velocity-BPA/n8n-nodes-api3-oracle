# Bringing Web3 Oracle Data to Your n8n Workflows: Introducing the API3 Oracle Node

We're excited to announce the release of our latest community node for n8n: the API3 Oracle protocol integration. Developed by Velocity BPA, this node bridges the gap between decentralized oracle infrastructure and your automation workflows.

## The Challenge of Web3 Data Integration

As blockchain technology matures, businesses increasingly need to interact with on-chain data and decentralized oracle networks. API3 represents a cutting-edge oracle solution providing first-party data feeds through dAPIs, but integrating these services into business workflows has traditionally required custom development and blockchain expertise.

## What This Node Enables

The n8n-nodes-api3-oracle brings comprehensive API3 protocol functionality directly into your n8n automation environment. Whether you're building DeFi applications, monitoring blockchain events, or creating governance workflows, this node provides the connectivity you need.

## Key Features

**dAPI Integration**: Access first-party data feeds with quantifiable security through API3's managed data feeds. Query real-time price data, market information, and other oracle services without writing custom smart contract code.

**Airnode Operations**: Interact with API3's first-party oracle nodes, enabling direct access to off-chain data sources in a decentralized manner.

**OEV Auction Participation**: Tap into Oracle Extractable Value auctions, allowing sophisticated users to participate in MEV opportunities through automated workflows.

**DAO Governance**: Automate participation in API3 DAO governance processes, including proposal monitoring and voting operations.

**Staking Management**: Monitor and manage API3 staking positions directly from your n8n workflows.

## Getting Started

Installation is straightforward. In your n8n instance, run:


npm install n8n-nodes-api3-oracle


After restarting n8n, you'll find the API3 Oracle node in your node panel, ready to integrate into your workflows.

## Who Should Use This?

This node is perfect for blockchain developers, DeFi teams, Web3 automation specialists, and anyone building workflows that need reliable oracle data. It's also valuable for organizations exploring blockchain integration without committing to full custom development.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

The node is fully open source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/Velocity-BPA/n8n-nodes-api3-oracle. We welcome contributions, feature requests, and feedback from the community.

## Need Custom Node Development?

At Velocity BPA, we specialize in building custom n8n nodes and automation solutions tailored to your specific business needs. If you're looking to integrate proprietary systems, legacy applications, or emerging technologies into your n8n environment, we'd love to help.
